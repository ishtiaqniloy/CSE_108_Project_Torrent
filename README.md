# CSE_108_Project_Torrent
CSE 108 Torrent Project developed using JavaFX and Java socket programming.

In this project, we have not implemented an actual torrent client which could be used instead of bittorrent. Rather, we have created a customized torrent like system to download files from multiple sources and also send data to multiple downloaders simultaneously with the help of a tracker. 

Supervisor: Ch. Md. Rakin Haider, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka-1000.
